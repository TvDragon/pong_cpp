# Pong
## Motivation

This is the classic Pong game that all retro players remember. The absolute beauty of a game like this can never be forgotten. I wanted to remake this game as it was something I played often because of how fun it it was given its simplicity. I also took this opportunity to try creating buttons for you to select the difficulty and whether you wanted to play this solo or against a friend in person.
